# Demonstration Links for Large Screen Arrays (HIVE & DRMC)

## The South Omo River Region Survey  
This is a project to enumerate current nomadic pastoralist settlements in Southern Ethiopia for planning a baseline public health survey. The project presented a number of challenges, not the least of whick was how to identify the current location of highly ephemeral settlements in order to design a randomized baseline health survey. The remote and extremely sparsely 

The project began with a task on the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Task Manager: 

[http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/2883](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/2883)  

* *Open the task #2883 and show the Description and Instructions tabs*  
* *Go to the Contribute tab, take a task at random and zoom and pan around the square, demonstrating digitization if features present themselves (they may not, there is very little population, here)*
* *Unlock the task, then select an orange square and demonstrate validation. This is where the very large screen arrays are most vauable. You can zoom to the validation sqare in ID Editor, so that you fill the screen array with the task square, horizinatally. Holding down the Shift key and using the arrow keys will allow you to pan an entire screen, so that if you pan down, once, after zooming, you can validate an entire square in seconds.*

## DigitalGlobe Imagery Grant / ArcGIS Online
The OSM portion of the survey was done to identify where people *tend* to be, but because of the ephemeral nature of the settlements, and the unknown age of much of the source imagery, it was necessary to obtain "fresh" imagery to enumerate the settlements. 

Through a generous imagery grant from the DigitalGlobe Foundation, we were able to obtain imagery acquired on 

### ArcGIS Online
It was decided, for the following reasons, not to use OSM as the platform for enumerating current settlements:

1. Licensing of the DigitalGlobe Foundation Grant imagery did not explicitly enable us to share the imagery in a public platform.
2. OpenStreetMap's ODbL license, and it's "share-alike" clause, make using data from OSM in concert with Personal Health Information (PHI), problematic.
3. Though there is no known evidence of the use of OSM data in confict's, the proximity of the area of interest to high confict zone's (South Sudan and it's disputed boundaries with Kenya) made it advisable to use non-public means of reconnainsance, out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the study subjects.
